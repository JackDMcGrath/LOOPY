# LOOPY

LOOPY is an open-source package in Python designed to identify and correct unwrapping errors in interferograms. It is written as an add-on to the COMET [LiCSBAS](https://github.com/yumorishita/LiCSBAS) software.

Having pre-processed their data in LiCSBAS, LOOPY can then be run on the unwrapped interferograms. To then include these in further time-series analysis, rerun LiCSBAS from step 12 (Loop Phase Closure Check)

THIS IS RESEARCH CODE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS IS" WITH NO WARRANTIES OF CORRECTNESS. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
